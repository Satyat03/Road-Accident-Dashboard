# Road-Accident-Dashboard

I have meticulously crafted an extensive overview of road accidents spanning the years 2021 and 2022. The primary goal was to deliver insightful analytics to clients, offering a deeper understanding of accident patterns and trends. Allow me to provide a glimpse into my strategic methodology:

🔍 Data Collection & Refinement: I initiated the process by importing the CSV file, undertaking a series of tasks such as applying filters, eliminating duplicates, rectifying errors, and molding the data into a format conducive to seamless analysis.

🔄 Data Transformation: In order to establish trendlines for current year (CY) and prior year (PY) casualties, I introduced Year and Month columns by leveraging the TEXT() function on the Date column.

🔍 Augmented Functionality: I integrated filter panels and established connections to essential pivot tables, ensuring a streamlined user experience. Additionally, I implemented hyperlinks and connections to pertinent icons, facilitating effortless navigation. A dedicated Data Analysis sheet was crafted to condense all pivot table data, providing a succinct resource for newcomers, developers, or clients to enhance their workflow and access crucial information.

📊 Formulated Total Casualties Data using Pivot Table on the Dashboard.
📊 Implemented a Doughnut chart to analyze Total casualties and their percentages concerning accident severity.
📊 Utilized Pivot Table analyze option to consolidate similar vehicle types.
📊 Created a Doughnut chart specifically for analyzing maximum casualties in the Car category, incorporating vehicle type icons from the Illustration section.
📊 Developed a dataset of Total Casualties with respect to Vehicle Type, featuring diverse vehicle type icons in the Dashboard.
📊 Devised a 2-D Combo Line chart illustrating the Monthly trend and comparing casualties for the Current Year (CY) and Prior Year (PY).
📊 Constructed a Bar Chart to identify maximum casualties by Road Type.
📊 Merged similar Road surface conditions and generated a Treemap chart showcasing the distribution of total casualties across various Road Surface types.
📊 Aggregated similar Light conditions and crafted a Doughnut chart to understand the relationship between casualties based on Area/Location and Day/Night.
